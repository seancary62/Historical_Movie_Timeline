# Ultimate_Movie_Lists
Personal project to explore and categorize movies in different ways.

# Getting Started
After some initial exploration, I've found a few discoveries that might be useful. I will be reusing some of code from my final team project for the UNCC Charlotte Data Viz Bootcamp. My team and I found a movie data base online with a very workable API. My first task was to create a list of historic events, people, and icons that would be used to sort through a list of movies. Dates were added as well to make it easier to add the movies to a timeline. 

As there may be a lot of movies, I've decided to seperate the project into time periods. The first segment will cover everything that occurs before 1 AD. 

The following websites were used to create a list of historic topics and get date ranges:
